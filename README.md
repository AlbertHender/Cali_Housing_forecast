# Project Name: California Housing Market Analysis and Forecast

### Project Status: Complete

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze the housing market trends in various cities in California, including Fresno, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Luis Obispo, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Merced. By utilizing data obtained through the Zillow API and the Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis .By implementing an XgBoost machine learning model, I aim to forecast future housing prices and provide valuable insights into the market. This project mainly aims to assist potential future home owners and those in real estate into the potential future for the housing market.

## Project Description
This project focuses on the analysis of housing market data from eight major cities in California. The data was sourced from the Zillow API and FRED, which provides comprehensive real estate and consumer price index (CPI) data. Our primary objective is to create a reliable time series forecasting model using XgBoost to predict future housing prices. 

Key questions and hypotheses include:
- How do housing prices vary across different cities in California?
- What are the trends and patterns in the housing market over time?
- Can we accurately forecast future housing prices using machine learning models?

Challenges faced:
- Handling and preprocessing large datasets
- Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the forecasting model
